some memo about how to check out zimbra open source version from Perforce.

1. As zimbra uses perforce, we must get a perforce client.
http://www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce-Software-Version-Management/complete_list/20-20#6

2. Perforce command line client is a binary and depends on an absolute folder.
mkdir /home/public/p4

3. Use p4 client to checkout source.
p4 -u public -P public1234 -c public-view sync -f //depot/zcs/XXX/...
XXX is for branch, like "HELIX-714". Dont't forget the last "...".
Source file will be checkout to /home/public/p4.
